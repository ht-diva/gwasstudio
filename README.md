# GWASStudio: A Tool for Genomic Data Management

![alt text](image.png)


## Overview

GWASStudio is a powerful CLI tool designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and querying of genomic summary statistics. It offers a high-performance infrastructure for handling and analyzing large-scale GWAS and QTL datasets, enabling seamless cross-dataset exploration.

## Core Purpose

GWASStudio provides a unified interface across the [SCDH](https://github.com/ht-diva/cdh_in_a_box) infrastructure, handling the ingestion, storage, querying and export of genomic data using high-performance technologies.

## Key Functionalities

GWASStudio consists of several key functionalities:

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Data Ingestion**: Imports summary statistics data and its metadata associated.
- **Support for Multiple Storage Options**: Works with both local filesystems and cloud storage (S3).

### 2. Data Querying
- **Flexible Search**: Enables searching metadata using template files.

### 3. Data Export
- **Selective Export**: Extracts subsets of data and its metadata associated based on genomic regions, SNPs, or the entire set of data.

## Technical Architecture

GWASStudio leverages several advanced technologies:

1. **TileDB Embedded**: A high-performance array storage engine that enables efficient storage and retrieval of genomic data.
2. **MongoDB**: A flexible, scalable NoSQL database used for storing and querying metadata associated with genomic datasets.
3. **Dask**: Provides distributed computing capabilities for processing large datasets.
4. **Python Ecosystem**: Built on Python with libraries like Click/Cloup for CLI interfaces, Pandas for data manipulation, and various genomics-specific tools.

## Installation

To get started with GWASStudio, follow these installation steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ht-diva/gwasstudio
cd gwasstudio

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
conda env create --file base_environment.yml
conda activate gwasstudio

# Install the package
make install

# Verify installation
gwasstudio --version
```

## Usage
